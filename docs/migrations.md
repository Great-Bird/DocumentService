# Migrations

There is no example here yet. However, migrations in DocumentService are very
similar to migrations in Lapis, which has a [good tutorial page here](https://nezuo.github.io/lapis/docs/Migrations).

Have a good example with a well-written explanation? [Contribute here!](https://github.com/anthony0br/DocumentService/pulls)
